In this blog post, I am going to share five inspirational quotes that have stuck with me since I read them. For each one of them, I would try to provide some insight about why I found them interesting.

## On the value of learning

I read this quote from the amazing book of Robert Greene **Mastery** where he shares his insights on how to achieve mastery in a domain. The book was a great read, through the analysis of some of the great minds, Robert Greene teaches us what it takes to be great at something. Here are some points why I deem this quote interesting:

* Skills learned today will serve your entire life.
* You might never have time to learn what you can today.
* Learn anytime. Anywhere.
* Donâ€™t skip classes hoping you would make up later.
* Time is the most valuable asset one has. Use it well.

## On the value of getting the right perspective

Stephen Covey is the mastermind behind the great book **The 7 habits of highly effective people** where he sheds some lights on how to be productive.

* Don't fail to understand the problem with the right perspective.
* Don't get into discussion before understanding what is the subject. Question others' perspective
* It will save you a relationship, a respect, various troubles.
* Never fail to see a problem through the right lens.

## Still on the value of getting the right perspective

I don't think there is even one person on earth who has tried at least something and who never fails at some point in his life. Getting the right behaviour when facing failure can be game changing.

* Everybody fails. The only difference is in how we behave after a failure.
* Learn from failures. Doing so, you gain something valuable from something eventually not valuable.
* Don't be afraid of failure. Embrass it as it shows you try things and don't always rely on your strenghs.

## On the importance of having self-confidence

Believing that you can achieve something is half-way to achieving it. For the things we wish to become reality, one should envision themselves in a position where they are in the possession of that thing.

* Believe in yourself.
* Rationality + Emotion = Success
* Nothing is solely impossible.

## On the importance of mastering one's choices

Our life is made of the decisions we make every single day. It is your responsibility to live your life up to what you deem important and work on what you cherish the most. Nobody should impose on you what you should be working on or dictate what is good for you. You should master your life choices and be responsible for them. It is true that sometimes doing this is hard, but remember whenever you have choice, make the right move thinking about you first.
